In this project, I worked on identifying and categorizing complaints based on different departments. I analyzed each issue by checking how often it occurred (frequency), how serious it was (impact), and how likely it was to happen (likelihood). Using this data, I created a risk matrix to prioritize the most critical risks that needed immediate attention.

Key Learnings:

Gained experience in data categorization and risk analysis.
Learned how to use a likelihood vs. impact matrix to evaluate and prioritize issues effectively.

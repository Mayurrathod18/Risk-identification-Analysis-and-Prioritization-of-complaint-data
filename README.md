This project focuses on identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing risks derived from organizational complaint data. The main goal was to understand the recurring issues raised by different departments, evaluate their seriousness, and design a structured approach to manage them more effectively.

The process began by collecting complaint data and categorizing each issue based on the department it was related to. This helped in organizing a large set of data into smaller, more manageable segments. Each complaint was then examined using three important parameters â€” frequency, impact, and likelihood.

  Frequency indicated how often a particular complaint occurred.

  Impact showed the potential effect or seriousness of the issue on operations.

  Likelihood measured the probability of the issue happening again in the future.

By combining these factors, the project aimed to develop a clear understanding of which problems were minor and which needed urgent action. To visualize this, a risk matrix was created, plotting likelihood on one axis and impact on the other. This matrix helped prioritize the risks according to their severity, ensuring that high-impact and high-likelihood issues received attention first.

The analysis not only helped in identifying key areas of concern but also supported better decision-making for risk management. It provided a foundation for preventive actions and improved complaint-handling processes. Departments could now focus on the most critical issues, allocate resources effectively, and reduce the chances of similar complaints recurring.

Through this project, I gained practical experience in risk management, data categorization, and analytical thinking. It also strengthened my ability to interpret raw data, convert it into meaningful insights, and present it in a structured and visually understandable format. Overall, the project demonstrated how systematic analysis of complaint data can lead to improved operational efficiency and proactive risk control within an organization.
